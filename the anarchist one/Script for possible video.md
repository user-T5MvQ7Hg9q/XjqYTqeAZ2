Right. Crazy first video, I know, but I feel like I'm going insane.

What the fuck is going on? Not in the world, I know what's going on there. Not in my country, it's a shit show but not what I wanna talk about. 

What the hell is Trump even about?

I mean... The tariffs and deportations of illegals and legals alike, I get those from his dumbass perspective. Not surprising. I also get defunding science and education and making lists of trans and autistic people from a fascist's perspective. That's the same shit the nazis did. But this man is calling for ceasefires on Truth Social. He's trying to get asbestos unbanned!

And for those who don't see a problem with that last one: asbestos has been banned completely in the EU for 20 years, and we're certainly not suffering for it. I legitimately can't think of a single EU country that isn't doing better than the US right now.

And now a Swedish young man, a little younger than me, has been detained, harassed and threatened with a 5 thousand dollar fine for having a meme image of bald JD Vance on his phone. No text, just the photoshopped picture. Something that Vance has reportedly laughed at himself!

I mean this isn't just evil anymore. It isn't even just comically evil. This is both comically evil and comically stupid! I don't see how people aren't laughing their ass off at this guy whenever he does literally anything! He fucking posted on his own social media platform that he's disappointed in both Israel and Iran, like a disappointed father! How can anyone take that seriously?

And then there's his way of handling any domestic conflicts. CEO gets shot, vast majority of people in the country are on the side of the assassin? Let's try to publicly execute him, that surely won't turn him into a martyr! And the protests... Okay to be fair he's done the media coverage of the protests really well, making it look as violent as they possibly can. But people are also seeing right through his schemes with the national guard and shit! It's a joke! He's a joke!

I mean, let me know what you think I guess? That's it, go away now.
